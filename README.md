Minidrone-js
---------------

Minidrone-js is an easy to use drone library for the Parrot 
Minidrones. In theory it supports many different Parrot drones 
besides Minidrones but this is untested. 

This library is loosely based on the work by [fetherston] 
([npm-parrot-minidrone]) and [amymcgovern] ([pymambo]).
